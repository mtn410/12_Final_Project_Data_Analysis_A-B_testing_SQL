# 12_Final_Project_Data_Analysis_A-B_testing_SQL
For the next two weeks, you'll be a junior analyst who's about to solve their first real tasks from major customers. You'll work simultaneously on a big project and on minor tasks, much like in real life. 

A/B Testing Project
You've received an analytical task from an international online store. Your predecessor failed to complete it: they launched an A/B test and then quit (to start a watermelon farm in Brazil). They left only the technical specifications and the test results. 

SQL Project
The coronavirus took the entire world by surprise, changing everyone's daily routine. City dwellers no longer spent their free time outside, going to cafes and malls; more people were home, reading books. That attracted the attention of startups that rushed to develop new apps for book lovers.
You've been given a database of one of the services competing in this market. It contains data on books, publishers, authors, and customer ratings and reviews of books. This information will be used to generate a value proposition for a new product. 

E-commerce: Product Range Analysis Final Project
